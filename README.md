## Cricket Match Predictor â€“ ML Project Summary

This project is a web app that predicts the winner of a cricket match using historical data from [Cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org). It uses a trained ML model and has a nice user interface built with Streamlit.

### What it does:

* Predicts which team will win based on:

  * Team names
  * Toss winner & decision
  * Venue
* Shows win probability as a percentage
* Updates data daily using `cron`
* Runs in a Docker container and is accessible via your VM's public IP

### How to run:

1. Clone the project:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snegalvarsan/CricketResultPredictor.git
   cd CricketResultPredictor
   ```

2. Run the setup:

### ðŸ§  Data & Model:

* Uses IPL match data from Cricsheet
* Trained on `team1`, `team2`, `venue`, `toss_winner`, and `toss_decision`
* Uses RandomForestClassifier
* Gives predictions + win % for both teams

 Cricsheet data is open and free for non-commercial and research purposes.
